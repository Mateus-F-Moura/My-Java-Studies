# Java Studies Repository

This repository serves as a centralized and organized record of my learning journey in the Java language. The goal is to document my progress, from basic concepts to advanced topics.

All source code is located inside the `/src` folder.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized based on the origin and purpose of the study material:

* ### /src/Beecrowd
    Contains my solutions for the logic and algorithm challenges from the Beecrowd platform (formerly Uri Online Judge).

* ### /src/Java_Completo
    Gathers exercises, projects, and notes developed during the "Java Completo" (Complete Java) course.

* ### /src/Unicap
    Stores practical assignments, projects, and academic activities from my degree at Universidade Católica de Pernambuco.

## 🎯 Objective

To maintain an organized history of my studies, facilitate future reference, and publicly demonstrate my dedication and evolution in the Java language and development ecosystem.
