# Java Studies Repository

This repository serves as a centralized and organized record of my learning journey in the Java language. The goal is to document my progress, from basic concepts to advanced topics.

All source code is located inside the `/src` folder.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized by fundamental programming concepts and paradigms:

### 📊 Arrays
Exercises focusing on array manipulation, including selection and traversal, statistical calculations, practical applications, and fundamental operations.

### 🔀 Conditionals
Exercises covering conditional structures such as if-else statements, switch-case constructs, ternary operators, and complex decision-making logic.

### 🔄 Loops
Exercises exploring iteration structures including for loops, while loops, do-while loops, nested loops, and real-world problem-solving applications.

### 🎯 Oop (Object-Oriented Programming)
Projects demonstrating core OOP principles through practical implementations:
- Banking systems and financial operations
- Geometric calculations and shape modeling
- Inventory and stock management
- Employee and student record systems

Each project implements key concepts like encapsulation, classes, objects, constructors, and methods.

### ⚡ Sequentially
Exercises on sequential programming fundamentals, including basic input/output operations, sequential logic flow, and step-by-step problem solving.

## 🎯 Objective

To maintain an organized history of my studies, facilitate future reference, and publicly demonstrate my dedication and evolution in the Java language and development ecosystem.
